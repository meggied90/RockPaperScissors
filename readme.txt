* I've gotten a better understanding of array functions and string comparisons, nixed the 1,2,3 conversion I had before
* Fixed weird file nesting issue
* Overall tidier code

What I learned:
* The correct use of =, ==, and ===
* The important difference between var, let, and const
* First attempt at a do/while loop (which has not been taught in the course yet)
* How to account for NaN/unacceptable user submissions
* Nesting functions and global vs. local variable use
